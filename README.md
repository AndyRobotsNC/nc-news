# NC NEWS

## Introduction

I was tasked with creating a front-end application for my back-end project.
The back-end API repository can be found here - https://github.com/AndyRobotsNC/nc-news-app </br>
The app is hosted at - https://compassionate-yonath-70bb69.netlify.app/

## Technologies Used

React was used to create the whole of the functionality and CSS was used for the styling.

## Navigating the App

To log into the site the username is 'jessjelly'. This will give the user access to features
such as 'upvoting' comments and adding and deleting the comments.</br> You will also be able to
sort the articles in various different ways.

## Setup

To setup the project locally:

<ol>
<li>Navigate to your desired directory.</li>
<li>Run this code in your terminal.</li>
git clone https://github.com/AndyRobotsNC/nc-news.git
<li>cd into nc-news.</li>
<li>npm install to install all the dependencies</li>
</ol>

## Improvements

If given more time, I would have liked to improve the styling of the app, and whilst doing so </br>
learn a new technology such as Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap, to gain more styling knowledge.
